# Welcome to frads documentation

**Version: 2.1.8**

Frads is an open-source library providing high-level abstraction of Radiance matrix-based simulation workflows.

Frads automates setup of these simulations by providing end users with an open-source, high-level abstraction of the Radiance command-line workflow (Unix toolbox model), helping to reduce the steep learning curve and associated user errors. frads also provides the necessary infrastructure needed for seamless integration of Radiance and other modeling tools, such as EnergyPlus.

## Intended audience

1. Developers who are interested in incorporating multi-phase matrix methods into their software and are seeking examples and guidance; i.e., LBNL-suggested default parameters and settings; and,
2. Engineering firms, researchers, and students who are comfortable working in the command-line or Python scripting environment and tasked with a project that cannot be completed with existing tools.

## Why matrix-based methods?

Matrix algebraic methods reduce the time needed to perform accurate, ray-tracing based, annual daylight simulations by several orders of magnitude.

## Table Of Contents
